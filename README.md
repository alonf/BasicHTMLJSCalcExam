# Check your HTML and JavaScript knowledge

In this exercise you will complete some missing part of a simple calculator HTML and JavaScript based program. Some of the steps requires to change the current code while other require to complete missing parts. The missing parts are marked as a comment with a capital letter from (A) to (H).

1. Change the caluclator border to 5
2. Fill the missing button text (A)
3. Fill the missing part (B) and make sure that basic calculations work.
4. Fix the remove character function (C) and test the '\<\<' button.
5. Fix the clearResult (D) and test the 'c' button
6. To fix the memory capabilities, fix the variable declaration (E).
7. Implement the missing part for the 'M-' key. (F)
8. Fix the memory clear functionality (G)

10. Try to calculate the expression: 10/0= you should get Infinity. Now press another number key - the key is added to the end of the Infinity text. Fix it by checking on any key press if the current value is equal to "Infinity" and if so clear the result text. (H)
11. Bonus area: Delete the comments (I) and implement the additional buttons as you understand them

The final result should looks like this:
